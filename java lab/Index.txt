1) Write a Java program to check whether a given number is prime or not.
2) Write a Java program to find the second smallest element in an array.
3) Write a Java program to multiply two given matrices.
4) Write a Java program to display the transpose of a given matrix.
5) Write a Java Program to find the frequency of a given character in a string.
6) Write a Java program to reverse a given string.
7) Java program to sort an array of strings in alphabetical order.
8) Write a Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
Ex: MALAYALAM is palindrome.

9) Write a Java program to calculate the area of different shapes namely circle, rectangle and triangle using the concept of method overloading.

10) Write a Java program to display the features of Java (Simple, Object-Oriented,Distributed, Robust, Secure, Portable, Multithreaded, Dynamic)
in below format, by using commandline arguments 
Ex: 1. Java is Simple
       2. Java is Object-Oriented

11) Write a Java program to find the perimeter of two rectangles using constructors.
(Use default constructor as well as parameterized constructor to initialize the value of length and breadth of the two rectangles.)

12) Write a menu driven program to manipulate a string using StringBuffer class as below:
- To insert a string into another string at a given position.
- To modify character at a given position
- To append a string at the end

13) Write two Java classes Employee and Engineer. Engineer should inherit from Employee class. Employee class to have two methods display() and calcSalary(). 
Write a program to display the engineer salary and to display from Employee class using a single object instantiation(i.e; only one object creation is allowed)
• display() only prints the name of the name of the class and does not return any value. Ex. " Name of class is
Employee".
• calcSalary() in Employee displays "Salary of employee is 10000" and calcSalary() in Engineer displays "Salary
of employee is 20000".

14) Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following
members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address,Salary. It also has a method named 'printSalary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee.
Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. 
Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.

15) Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named numberOfSides( ). 
Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. 
Each one of the classes contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the given geometrical structures.

16) Write a Java program to implement an interface. 
Create a class that implements
the CharSequence interface found in java.lang package. The implementation should return the string backwards. 
Make sure to call all four methods char charAt(int index), int length(), CharSequence subSequence(int start, int end) and String toString() which returns a string containing the characters in this sequence in the same order as this sequence. 

17)  Write a Java program to illustrate Multiple inheritance. 

 Create an interface Sports which contains an interface variable sportWt set to value 6 and an abstract
 method putWt(). 
 Create a class Student having member variable rollNumber and two methods getNumber(int n)
 and putNumber() to read and display the rollNumber respectively.
 Create a class Test as the subclass of Student.
 It should contain two member variables part1 and part2 to hold the marks for each term. 
 It should also contain methods getMarks(float m1,float m2) and putMarks() to read and display the marks obtained for part1 and part2. 

 Create a class Results which derives the features of Test class and Sports interface. This class should display
 the sportWt and should have a display() method to display the total marks( calculated as total= part1+part2+sportWt) in below format: 

RollNo:1234 
Marks Obtained 
Part1=27.5 
Part2=33 
SportsWt = 6 
Total Score=66.5 

18) Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of garbage collector.
19) Write a Java program that shows the usage of try, catch, throws and finally.
20) Write a Java program that shows how to create a user-defined exception.
21) Write a Java program that reads from a file and writes to a file by handling all file related exceptions.(Using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes)
22) Write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the sum of all the integers (Use String Tokenizer class of java.util).

23) Write a Java program that reads a file and displays the file on the screen, with a line number before each line.
24) Write a Java program with reader/writer class that displays the number of characters, lines and words in a text file.
